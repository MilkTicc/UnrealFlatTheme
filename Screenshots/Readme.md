## Unreal Flat Theme

A Flat Theme for Unreal Engine 4. Work in progress.

### How to Install

Just copy the Engine Folder into your Unreal Engine Folder where it is installed, and replace all the files.

The background of the window won't be replaced automatically, you can change it through the *Editor Preferences* > *Appearance* > *Colors* > **Editor Main Window Background Override** ( Set it to your own image or replace it by black, which also looks good )

### What Does the Theme Change

* A flat looking Title Bar (Thanks to [LazyTheme](https://github.com/Xerios/LazyTheme))

* A flat looking Blueprint Editor
